I edited this repository, it is now in edit phase.
Next I will push it to stage and finallly I will commit it.

I have staged the file. What happens if I edit it while it it stages?
Lets find out..

it becomes modified but remains tracked. However, it is staged and unstaged, cool!

Okay new laptop, lets try this again.
